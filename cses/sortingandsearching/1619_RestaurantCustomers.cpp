/*
You are given the arrival and leaving times of n customers in a restaurant.
What was the maximum number of customers?
Input
The first input line has an integer n: the number of customers.
After this, there are n lines that describe the customers.
Each line has two integers a and b: the arrival and leaving times of a customer.
You may assume that all arrival and leaving times are distinct.
Output
Print one integer: the maximum number of customers.
Constraints
1<= n <= 2Â·10^5
1<= a<b <=10^9
Example
Input:
3
5 8
2 4
3 9
Output:
2
SOLUTION
Put all arrival and departures in a "timeline" array, then sort the array.
Increment the count when it is an arrival, else decrement.
Time O(N lg N)
Space O(N)
